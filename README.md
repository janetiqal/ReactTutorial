# ReactTutorial

## Description
I wanted to dip my toes into the React.js framework in order to be a stronger developer. This tutorial is an intro to react that builds a game of tic-tac-toe where I learned the fundamentals of building a React application. I set up a local development enviornment instead of working in the browser, to mimick my coding enviornment.

## Tutorial
I followed this [link](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-for-the-tutorial) in order to build this game.
